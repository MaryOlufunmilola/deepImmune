Running hyperparam_train.py 

Training is done using bbopt https://github.com/evhub/bbopt

-1) install bbopt from `pip install bbopt`
In hyperparam_train.py:
0) set the default directories in the parser to where the data actually is, etc 
1) add any bbopt modifiable params in the setup_and_train function 
	-see the learning rate example
	-for more ways to define params see: https://github.com/evhub/bbopt#parameter-definition-methods
  -also can change the parameter selection method: https://github.com/evhub/bbopt#run 
      -search of `bb.run` in hyperparam_train.py to see where to change this 
2) at the command line, run `bbopt hyperparam_train.py -n <n> -j <j>` 
	-n is the number of trials to run 
	-j is the number of processes (cores) 

The result across all runs is stored in hyperparam_train.bbopt.json. You can see all the params and results there.
